== Description ==

Harness the power of [appear.in](http://appear.in "appear.in") by embedding secure peer-to-peer video chat rooms on a self-hosted WordPress site via the [appear_in] shortcode.

= Shortcode =

Set a custom public room name, specify which room buttons are shown on a page, change the button text, determine where rooms will be displayed, and set height of inline rooms.

= Settings =

If a public room name has not been explicitly defined in settings or shortcode, then the default public room expires daily.

The 'post' room type will generate a public room with name of the current post.

Button for toggling room position.
Buttons for inviting others via Twitter, Facebook, and email.
